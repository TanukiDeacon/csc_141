If I had infinite coding skills i would want to make a hack and slash game with a high level of customizability.
I would make it a sci-fi with mecha with many different options for ranged and melee weapons and diffternt types of body frames 
and armor options that change stats and looks. My main inspiration ofr this is the Devil may cry series and Armored core series.

I would also like to make a 3D metroidvania. One of the reasons I would like to do this is because I haven't seen many 3D platforming 
metroidvanias. It would be based inside an expansive cave system from which you have to escape.

Finally I would want to make an online card game. I'v always wanted to make a card game and I have actually already started 
working on it.
